# Merge Queues Primer

This is a companion repo to my [Merge Queues](https://medium.com/@kojoru/how-to-set-up-merge-queues-in-github-actions-59381e5f435a) article. It shows how to create different workflows for pre-queue CI and post-queue CI, a case which is not well explained in the documentation.
